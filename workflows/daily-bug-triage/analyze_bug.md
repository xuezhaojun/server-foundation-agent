# Sub-Agent Instructions: Analyze a Single Jira Bug

You are an analysis sub-agent for the daily bug triage workflow. Your job is to analyze **one** Jira bug by searching the Server Foundation codebase to find the root cause.

## Input

You receive a single bug object with these fields:

```json
{
  "key": "ACM-12345",
  "summary": "MCA will not update hosting-cluster-name annotation",
  "description": "When a ManagedClusterAddon is moved...",
  "priority": "Major",
  "assignee": "Le Yang",
  "assignee_email": "leyan@redhat.com",
  "components": ["Server Foundation"],
  "sprint": "",
  "created": "2026-03-10T...",
  "updated": "2026-03-12T...",
  "url": "https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/ACM-12345"
}
```

## Analysis Procedure

### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Repository

Use these signals (in priority order) to determine which repo(s) to search:

1. **Keywords in summary/description** — Match against known patterns:

   | Keyword | Likely Repo(s) |
   |---------|----------------|
   | MCA, ManagedClusterAddon, addon | `multicloud-operators-foundation` or `addon-framework` |
   | import, klusterlet, ManagedCluster import | `managedcluster-import-controller` |
   | proxy, konnectivity, tunnel | `cluster-proxy` or `cluster-proxy-addon` |
   | ServiceAccount, managed-sa | `managed-serviceaccount` |
   | permission, ClusterPermission, RBAC | `cluster-permission` |
   | foundation, clusterinfo, ManagedClusterInfo | `multicloud-operators-foundation` |
   | metrics, state-metrics | `clusterlifecycle-state-metrics` |
   | klusterlet-addon | `klusterlet-addon-controller` |
   | OCM, registration, work agent | `ocm` |

2. **Component field** — If components include a repo-like name, use it.

3. **Assignee ownership** — Read `team-members/member-ownership.md` to see what repos the assignee owns.

4. **Repo inventory** — Use `docs/repos.md` for the full list of SF repos.

### Step 2: Search the Codebase

Search the relevant repo under `repos/` (read-only submodules). Use Grep and Glob to find relevant code:

- Search for CRD names, controller names, function names mentioned in the bug
- Look for the specific annotation, field, or behavior described in the bug
- Find the controller reconciler or handler that manages the affected resource
- Read the relevant code to understand the logic flow

**Important**: `repos/` submodules may not be initialized. If a repo directory is empty, note this in your analysis and check if the code is available in an alternative location (e.g., `repos/server-foundation/ocm-io/` vs `repos/server-foundation/stolostron/`).

### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

Based on the code you found:

1. **Trace the logic path** — Follow the controller reconcile loop or handler that should handle the behavior described in the bug
2. **Identify the gap** — Find where the expected behavior diverges from actual behavior
3. **Pinpoint the code** — Note specific file paths and line numbers where the issue originates
4. **Assess confidence** — Rate your confidence based on how well the code matches the bug description

### Step 4: Suggest a Fix (if possible)

If you identified the root cause, briefly describe what code change would fix it. Do NOT make any actual code changes — this is analysis only.

## Output

Write the analysis result to `.output/bug-triage/analyses/bug-<KEY>.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p .output/bug-triage/analyses
```

### Result Schema

```json
{
  "key": "ACM-12345",
  "summary": "MCA will not update hosting-cluster-name annotation",
  "priority": "Major",
  "assignee": "Le Yang",
  "url": "https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/ACM-12345",
  "analysis_status": "root-cause-found | partial-analysis | insufficient-info | error",
  "relevant_repo": "stolostron/multicloud-operators-foundation",
  "relevant_files": ["pkg/controllers/addon/addon_controller.go:125"],
  "root_cause": "Human-readable explanation of the root cause",
  "suggested_fix": "Brief description of how to fix it, or empty string if unknown",
  "confidence": "high | medium | low",
  "notes": "Any additional context, caveats, or related information"
}
```

### Analysis Status Guide

| Status | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `root-cause-found` | You identified the specific code causing the issue and can explain why it fails |
| `partial-analysis` | You found relevant code and have a hypothesis, but cannot confirm the exact root cause |
| `insufficient-info` | The bug description lacks enough detail (no repro steps, vague symptoms, missing context) |
| `error` | You encountered a technical error during analysis (submodule not initialized, etc.) |

### Confidence Guide

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| `high` | You found the exact code, the bug description matches the behavior, and the fix is clear |
| `medium` | You found relevant code and have a plausible explanation, but there may be other factors |
| `low` | You found possibly related code but the connection to the bug is uncertain |

## Handling Edge Cases

- **Empty description**: Set `analysis_status` to `insufficient-info`, note "Bug has no description"
- **Multiple possible repos**: Analyze the most likely one; mention alternatives in `notes`
- **Non-code issue** (infra, config, deployment): Set `analysis_status` to `partial-analysis`, explain in `notes`
- **Submodule not initialized**: Set `analysis_status` to `error`, note "Repository submodule not initialized under repos/"
- **Cannot determine relevant repo**: Set `analysis_status` to `insufficient-info`, explain what signals were missing

## Important Notes

- This is **read-only analysis** — do NOT modify any code, create branches, or push changes
- Only search under `repos/` — these are read-only submodules
- Write the result JSON even if analysis fails — the main workflow needs it
- Keep `root_cause` and `suggested_fix` concise (2-3 sentences max)
- Include file paths with line numbers where possible (e.g., `pkg/foo/bar.go:42`)
