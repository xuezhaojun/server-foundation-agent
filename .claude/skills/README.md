# Skills

Skills are task-specific workflows the agent can execute. Each skill has a step-by-step checklist in its `SKILL.md`. All skills use the `sfa-` prefix (Server Foundation Agent) for discoverability.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `.claude/skills/sfa-<category>-<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a step-by-step checklist
2. Update this table
3. (Optional) Add a CronJob in `deploy/cronjobs/` if the skill should run on a schedule
4. Open a PR — the skill is available to the agent once merged
